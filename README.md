# Low Birth Weight and Maternal Risk Factors

This project explores the relationship between low birth weight in newborns and various maternal characteristics using logistic regression. It was completed as part of a university-level statistics course and demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modelling using R.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify maternal variables that significantly predict the likelihood of a low birth weight outcome, and to develop a logistic regression model based on these predictors.

## 📊 Overview of the Analysis
The analysis involved:
- Descriptive statistics of maternal variables (age, weight, smoking, etc.)
- Boxplots and mosaic plots to explore associations
- Logistic regression models (full, stepwise, and reduced)
- Model comparison using ANOVA
- Interpretation of significant predictors and goodness-of-fit testing

Final model variables:
- Maternal weight
- Race
- Smoking status
- History of hypertension

## 🔒 Data Access
The dataset used in this project cannot be shared due to licensing/privacy restrictions. It consists of 187 observations and 9 variables related to maternal demographics and pregnancy outcomes.

## 📄 Report
The full report detailing the methodology, results and discussion can be found in the [`file`](/LBW-study.pdf) inside the repository.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- R and RStudio
- Logistic regression modelling
- ANOVA and deviance testing

## 📚 References
All cited studies are included in the final report.
